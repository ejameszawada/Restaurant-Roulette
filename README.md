# Restaurant-Roulette
Ole Miss Senior Project

# Description
This website was created as my senior project at the University of Mississippi. This website allows users to get a random restuarant from the Oxford, MS area if they are feeling indecisive. The website also offers filters in case the user knows what they do/do not want, but are not sure of a specific restaurant. The filters include price, cuisine type, and restaurant/fast food. If a user creates a profile, the website can also keep track of the previous three restaurants they have visited.
